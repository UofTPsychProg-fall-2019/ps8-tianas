### In this problem set, you will tidy up an IAT dataset 
### The original data is available at https://osf.io/szwuf/, but it comes as an SPSS .sav file
### I've included trimmed down .csv version of 2019's data in this repository for you to work with

# loading libraries  ---------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)

# reading in IAT data  ---------------------------------------------

# use a tidyverse function to read in the included IAT_2019.csv file 
tbl <- read_csv("IAT.csv")

# Removing unnecessary rows and columns  ---------------------------------------------
# This data frame only contains 21 of the 454 available variables, but it's still too much

# use tidyverse functions so that only the following variables are included: 'session_id',"genderidentity","raceomb_002","D_biep.White_Good_all","Mn_RT_all_3467",
#       "edu_14","politicalid_7","STATE","att_7","tblacks_0to10","twhites_0to10","labels"

tbl_clean <- select(tbl, -c(13:21))

#### assuming that "genderidentity" means the "gender" column

# next, clean up the rows 
# our primary dependent variable is D_biep.White_Good_all, but some subjects
# don't have any data. Remove the rows with missing D_biep.White_Good_all entries 

tbl_clean <- drop_na(tbl_clean, D_biep.White_Good_all)

# Renaming variables  ---------------------------------------------

# next rename variables with more intuitive, short labels 
# here are some suggestions (along with variable info)
# id : session_id (subject number)
# gender : genderidentity (gender 1 "Male" 2 "Female" 3 "Trans male/Trans man" 4 "Trans female/Trans woman" 5 "Genderqueer/Gender nonconforming" 6 "A different identity") 
# race : raceomb_002 (race: 1 "American Indian" 2 "East Asian" 3 "South Asian" 4 "Hawaiian Pacifica Islander" 5 "black Africian American" 6 "white" 7 "other" 8 "multiracial")
# bias :D_biep.White_Good_all (overall IAT score)
# rt : Mn_RT_all_3467 (overall reaction time)
# edu : edu_14 (education: 1 "elementary" 2 "junior high" 3 "some high school" 4 "HS grad" 5 "some college" 6 "associate's" 7 "bachelor's" 8 "some grad" 9 "MA" 10 "JD" 11 "MD" 12 "PHD" 13 "other advanced" 14 "MBA")
# pol : politicalid_7 (political identification: 1 "strongly conservative 7 "strongly liberal)
# state : STATE
# att : att_7 (race attitude 1 "strongly prefer AA" 7 "strongly prefer white")
# temp_b : tblacks_0to10 (temperature feelings black 1 "extremely cold" 10 "extremly warm")
# temp_w : twhites_0to10 (temperature feelings black 1 "extremely cold" 10 "extremly warm")

### I didn't recode the scalar values (pol, att, temp_b, temp_w) because I'm not sure that really makes sense in this table

#  missing values  ---------------------------------------------

# some of our variables have missing values that aren't properly coded as missing  
# recode missing values in gender and state

#unique(tbl_clean$state)

# changing variable types  ---------------------------------------------  
# next, convert id and all variables that are character types to factors
# try to convert all variables at once using tidyverse functions
